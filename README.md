# CODINGPROJECTS
"see" is basically just a clicker. You can get as many numbers as you like. From this assignment, I learned more how to use the ".value" function in FLET.
"dropdowntest" is.. well.. a test. It was an assignemnt for a dropdown in FLET. It allows you to write a color and add it to a dropdown list. It helped me to use  dropdowns, obviously.
"SHOPPING" is something I never finished BUT you can make your own shopping list!! I learned how to add words into FLET (as in writing a word and adding it to the program), as well as using README files.
